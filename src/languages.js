One in two Arab men is smoking, which is in high contrast with for example the UK, where the same rate for men is less than one in five (acc. to the Office of National statistics 2016 survey). At the same time, the smoking rate among Arab women is on average twice lower than their western counterparts.",

For convenience, we split them into three groups: those smoking less than 10 cigarettes a day, between 10 and 20 and more than 20. Additionally, assuming that an average pack of cigarettes costs 35 shekels, you can see how much that cost per week, month and year.",
    "chart4": "Smoking is one of the most pervasive habbits and it is hard quit. We asked our male respondents who attempted to quit to pick reasons, which in their view would explain what these attempts were unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the age or socio-economic status, “Lack of will power” was the most popular answer.",
