A Data Visualization App, shows the health status of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel.

## Minimal Viable Product
This mvp is designed for mobile phone (not for desktop).

## Where is the data coming from?:

[The Galilee Society](http://www.gal-soc.org): is an NGO dedicated to lower the gap and equality between  the Palestinian Arabs and the Jewish majority in Israel. One of the Galilee Departments is Rikaz, Rikaz is responsible to create and make data by surveys, through this App we aim to make Rikaz data more accessible to general public.  

## How is the data visualized?:

The main library that we use for data-visualization is [D3.js](https://d3js.org), also some of the charts are based on plain vanilla JS.

For user interactions: **filtering** the data and filling the forms is done using the library [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org).  

## An example of a user journey

1. The user visit the website goes to the landing page.

1. The user selects which topic to view e.g Health Status.

1. The user selects which sub-topic to visualize it's data e.g. smoking.

1. The user now looks to the charts, and once the filters is changed by the user the charts will updated accordingly.
